Jupyter notebooks as a service at IQSS
======================================

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) allow users to run programs and view output directly in a web browser. The Jupyter project provides docker images for running temporary notebooks on demand. This sub-project of the Jupyter organization is called [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb). 

 The Data Science Services team (DSS; formerly known as Research Technology Consulting) has long desired to make workshop materials "live" so that people who cannot attend the workshops in person can modify and run the examples directly on our website. With the development of tmpnb this is now technically feasible.
 
 This repository contains a Dockerfile and other materials that can be used to create a tmpnb service providing interactive versions of DSS workshop notes.
